# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 17, 2023

<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Refresher JavaScript, also included Learning How To Learn by Barbara Oakley.

**Thoughts:**
I needed to really set things straight, I have some problems with procrastination after encountering some life problems caused by external factors, I decided that I shouldn't stay this way because nothing good will come out of this later on. I need to get back on the road and move forward if I really want to change my life.

I have included the techniques of Learning How To Learn by Barbara Oakley using Pomodoro to help me with procrastination. That is, focusing for 25 minutes straight with no distractions and then taking a break to enter diffuse mode. This goes for an hour prior the 100 days of code commitment.

**_Learning How To Learn_**
Chunks are build by focused mode, understanding the basic idea and practice. Recall by trying to remember the key ideas.
Balanced your studies by focusing on the more difficult parts.
Test yourself frequently to know whether you're fooling yourself or you're actually learning. Recall is an example of mini-tests. Mistakes are good. Use deliberate practice the hardest subjects you find.

Law of Serendipity: Lady Luck Favors The One Who Tries. Just pick one tiny thing to learn and then do the same for the others, it's surprising how you'll find out that you're learning quickly.

### Day 1: July 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learning How To Learn by Barbara Oakley.

**Thoughts:** I learned about how to deal with procrastination, using procrastination as a tool instead of an addiction. Learning different learning techniques such as Memory Palace, overlearning, pacing your knowledge, learning something on a balanced duration and not learning in one go. One should also try having a journal and write what they learned. The memory accepts and registers what you learned better than typing it on a keyboard.

### Day 2: July 19, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Officially started, refreshing JavaScript

**Thoughts** Currently learned about the basics of JavaScript again to brush up. Remembered to identify code and running the code. Also learning about JavaScript numbers and math.

Learned about the money problem (float) in JavaScript. It is advised to convert the dollars to cents to avoid inaccuracies when calculating float values. The order of operations and using Math.round().

**_Lesson 2: Numbers and Math_**
**_Lesson 3: Strings_**

### Day 3: July 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learned more bout float problems, strings and other use cases.

**Thoughts** I really hated math, but it's an important aspect. I had a hard time computing the taxes and using Math.round function. Took me a while, need more practice. I also learned some new terms of using strings in JavaScript.

**_Lesson 4: HTML, CSS, console.log and other JS Features Review_**

### Day 4: July 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: HTML, CSS, console.log and other JS features Review

**Thoughts** Reviewed the basics of HTML, and CSS. Set up VSCode. Loading JS inside an HTML file. Comments. console.log() along with practical exercises.

**_Lesson 5: JavaScript Variables and Other JS Features Review_**

### Day 5: July 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Variables and Other Features Review + Practical Exercises and Making a Simple Calculator

**Today's Progress**: Bonus Progress - Booleans and If-statements

**Thoughts**
Reviewed the basics of JavaScript Variables. 3 types of variables, const, let, and var. Learned how to re-assign the variable, replicated AMAZON's cart quality feature by making a simplified version out of it. Shortcuts for re-assigning a variable. Naming conventions and best practices. Along with practical and challenge exercises. Created a simple calculator to test the learned and reviewed skills.

Decided to include some part of the Booleans and if-statements in today's 100 days of code challenge. Practical exercises not included. This is still part 1.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/dan046/simple-calculator-100days-of-code // Note: Doesn't have an interface. Still reviewing variables and prior the lesson, everything is still inline. Will soon update.

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Find the Longest Word in a String](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/find-the-longest-word-in-a-string)
2. [Title Case a Sentence](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence) -->

### Day 6: July 27, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Booleans and If-statements, More Logical Operators Part 2: Rock-Paper-Scissors Simple Logic Game.

**Thoughts**
Continuation of the JavaScript Refresher, booleans and if-statements. Created a simple logic utilizing the rock paper scissors game algorithm to practice the logic of using conditional statements. Used Math.random() to generate random values used for results in a rock paper scissors game algorithms. Truthy and Falsy Values, shortcuts for if-statements, NaN (Not a Number), undefined values. Ternary, Guard and Default Operators. Also did some practical exercises to further refresh the knowledge.

Notes: Some of the code used in the refresher did ignore the concept of re-declaring block-scoped variables. This is not highly recommended and not the best practice.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/dan046/simple-calculator-100days-of-code // Note: Doesn't have an interface. Still reviewing conditional statements and logical operators and prior the lesson, everything is still inline. Will soon update. Will also update the code to a more dynamic value instead of using conditional statements, i.e. using loops soon. Still uses the same repo.

### Day 7: July 28, 2023

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Refresher Review - Functions

**Thoughts**
Finally started to learn about functions and some takes one need to be actually familiar with it.

**Link to work:** n/a considering to refactor the previous codes made into functions with conditional statements.

### Day 8: July 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Refresher Review - Delve Deeper into Loops, Operators, Some quizzes and exercises.

**Thoughts**
More information about loops and how they are used, also learned more about different operators, especially the bitwise operator. They kind of not needed but good to know as said. also did some quizzes. currently also learning about the conditional statements again which is under the control flow of operations and how they are used in programming.

### Day 9: July 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Refresher Exercises, Logic and Algorithms, Implementing Functions

**Thoughts**
Solved Basic JavaScript Refresher Exercises that would train my mind and methods on how to properly create functions that are clean and could deliver code the best way possible. Exercises like the fizzBuzz Algorithm, checking an image orientation, speed limit algorithm, finding the maximum number between two numbers algorithm, swapping values

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Refresher Exercises. Primes, show Stars, Grade, Learned about nested loops.
**Thoughts**
Solved basic to junior level JavaScript Refresher Exercises. Had some issues on providing and finding the logic and algorithm especially the primes. I'm not a fan of math but I know this is important to train my thinking ability on how to get to point A to point B. More so, this does include the probably reasoning on which best path to take in order to create cleaner and readable code.

### Day 12: August 03, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Dived deeper into functions, and for... loops. Exercises. JavaScript Objects (Objects, Factory Function Objects, Constructor Objects)

**Thoughts**
Redone some previous exercises, write some notes to help better familiarize the process of how to get to point A to point B and a deeper explanation out of it. Re-did some examples without following the tutorial to test whether I actually know the process. Also started learning about Objects and more functions. Currently learning about different ways to create objects.

### Day 13: August 04, 2023

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Refresher Fundamentals:

1. Dynamic Nature of Objects
2. Constructor Property
3. Functions are Objects
4. Value vs. Reference Types

**Thoughts**
Learned about the dynamic nature of objects, constructor properties, functions which are actually objects, difference between value and reference types. Values are independent and are copied by their value. References on the other hand are copied by their reference.

i.e.
Value Types
let number = 10
function increase(number){
number++
}
increase(number) // Output: 11 But that is stored somewhere in the memory.
console.log(number) // Output: 10

Reference Types:
let obj = {value: 10}
function increase(obj){
obj.value++
}
increase(obj) // Output: 11
console.log(obj) // Output: 11, this is because the values are copied by their reference. Any changes we made on the object is immediately reflected and visible to the other value.

### Day 14: August 06, 2023

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Refresher Fundamentals:

1. Enumerating Properties of an Object
2. Cloning an object
3. Garbage collection
4. built-in object properties Math and String.

**Thoughts**
Learned a lot of things, such as enumerating properties of an object using the for...in and for...of loops. The for...in method is the easiest way to get the properties of an object. The for...of loop on the other hand, requires iterating an array and maps. To solve this issue, you can use Object.keys which will return an array of the object.

The word Object is a built-in constructor function. Apart from .keys, we can also use Object.entries. Instead of returning a string array, it returns each value pair as an array.

Checking the property of a given object, use the in method. if ('radius' in circle).

Cloning objects, the easiest way and modern way of doing that is using the spread operator {...variable}. There are other methods like Object.assign or directly creating an empty object variable and using a for...in loop to iterate over the existing object and clone the value to the new empty object variable.

JS doesn't have the concept of garbage collection, however it is important to know that when we create a variable or constants, the memory is automatically allocated in that section. If we're done and not using it, the memory that was allocated is automatically deallocated. This happens behind the scenes and we have no control over it.

### Day 15: August 07, 2023

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Refresher Fundamentals: Object Exercises

1. Familiarizing the concepts in creating objects
2. asking the necessary questions like, "What properties I put in these objects?"
3. Drilling more Constructor and Factory Function Exercises.

**Thoughts**
I honestly thought creating objects is easy since I already am doing ReactJS, but then I realized things are more complex than they are, I've seen these pop up here and then and quite honestly, I've never been confused about constructor and factory functions. Constructor functions are confusing. Aren't you suppose to use class based
approach?

### Day 16: August 08, 2023

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Refresher Fundamentals: Arrays

1. Re-learning how to add elements in an array
2. ES6 feature - Arrow Functions
3. Combining and Slicing Arrays
4. The Best Practice to Empty Arrays
5. Finding Elements in an Array (Primitive and Reference Types)
6. Iterating Arrays
7. Joining Arrays
8. Removing Elements From the Arrays
9. Spread Operators

**Thoughts**
So far, the lessons are pretty straight forward compared to the objects. I honestly feel objects are highly confusing than arrays. Arrays had methods that are directly involved and does not require much modification compared to objects.

### Day 17: August 09, 2023

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Refresher Fundamentals: Arrays - Exercises - Practicing Array Algorithms And How they Actually Work inside functions. Creating Functions that simulate different array methods. Chaining of methods.

**Thoughts**
The exercises turned out to be quite harder than expected. The logic around each exercises is harder. I'm really just glad that these array methods have been invented and because of this, life just got a lot easier compared to creating the functions and implementing the algorithm yourself every single time.

### Day 18: August 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Refresher Fundamentals: Arrays - Exercises - Practicing Array Algorithms And How they Actually Work inside functions. Creating Functions that simulate different array methods. Chaining of methods.

**Thoughts**
Solved and resolved more exercises for this lesson. I decided to write out the steps to better visualize the flow and algorithm process on how each function would work and why they should be written that way. It's actually easier to digest and you could see the steps one by one if you go through these processes. It's like building a muscle memory out of the programming paradigm.

### Day 19: August 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**:
JavaScript Refresher Fundamentals: Arrays - Exercises - More Exercises to Train the Programming Brain.

1. Counting Duplicates
2. Displaying the highest number in an array
3. Manipulating array of objects

Lesson - Functions in a deeper detail.

1. Function Declaration vs. Function Expression
2. Hoisting
3. Arguments
4. The ...Rest Operator
5. Default Parameters
6. Getters and Setters
7. Error Handling Try and Catch Method

**Thoughts**
Solved and resolved more exercises for arrays and array of objects. Writing the steps seem to really work and does give a deeper understanding. Finally learned about functions. I realized I am using some of these methods already, I'm simply not familiar on it on a deeper and its terminologies. However, one thing that caught me off guard, are the lessons about the ...rest operator and getters and setters. It's my first time learning that the term was actually called rest when using it within the functions as parameter.

Getters and Setters also caught me off guard, I've never really seen these methods actually get used in real life situations prior my past learning methods. I am not sure how modern this thing is.

### Day 20: August 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**:
JavaScript Refresher Fundamentals:

1. Local and Global Scopes
2. let vs. var keywords
3. this keyword

**Thoughts**
Global scope is like something everyone in your entire neighborhood can see and use. Local scope is like something only the people inside a specific house can see and use.

let gives you flexible boxes where you can change what's inside anytime. var gives you boxes that are a bit more rigid, once you put something in, it's not so easy to change.

The "this" keyword kind of ends up confusing at some point especially when dealing with regular and arrow functions. The this keyword, when you use a regular function inside the loop, it's like the placeholder got lost and doesn't really know what it should refer to. So, it just defaults to something like nothing (undefined). For arrow functions, you're using a smarter placeholder (an arrow function). This arrow function knows where it's being used and automatically connects to the correct object. It's like the placeholder magically figures out that it should stand for the object, and everything works as expected.

The key difference is that arrow functions keep the same meaning of this as their surroundings (they're context-aware), while regular functions can have their own separate understanding of this (they're less context-aware).
