**Today's Progress**: Refresher JavaScript, also included Learning How To Learn by Barbara Oakley.

**Thoughts:**
I needed to really set things straight, I have some problems with procrastination after encountering some life problems caused by external factors, I decided that I shouldn't stay this way because nothing good will come out of this later on. I need to get back on the road and move forward if I really want to change my life.

I have included the techniques of Learning How To Learn by Barbara Oakley using Pomodoro to help me with procrastination. That is, focusing for 25 minutes straight with no distractions and then taking a break to enter diffuse mode. This goes for an hour prior the 100 days of code commitment.

***Learning How To Learn***
Chunks are build by focused mode, understanding the basic idea and practice. Recall by trying to remember the key ideas.
Balanced your studies by focusing on the more difficult parts.
Test yourself frequently to know whether you're fooling yourself or you're actually learning. Recall is an example of mini-tests. Mistakes are good. Use deliberate practice the hardest subjects you find.

Law of Serendipity: Lady Luck Favors The One Who Tries. Just pick one tiny thing to learn and then do the same for the others, it's surprising how you'll find out that you're learning quickly.

### Day 1: July 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learning How To Learn by Barbara Oakley.

**Thoughts:** I learned about how to deal with procrastination, using procrastination as a tool instead of an addiction. Learning different learning techniques such as Memory Palace, overlearning, pacing your knowledge, learning something on a balanced duration and not learning in one go. One should also try having a journal and write what they learned. The memory accepts and registers what you learned better than typing it on a keyboard.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
