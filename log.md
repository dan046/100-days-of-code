# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 17, 2023

<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Refresher JavaScript, also included Learning How To Learn by Barbara Oakley.

**Thoughts:**
I needed to really set things straight, I have some problems with procrastination after encountering some life problems caused by external factors, I decided that I shouldn't stay this way because nothing good will come out of this later on. I need to get back on the road and move forward if I really want to change my life.

I have included the techniques of Learning How To Learn by Barbara Oakley using Pomodoro to help me with procrastination. That is, focusing for 25 minutes straight with no distractions and then taking a break to enter diffuse mode. This goes for an hour prior the 100 days of code commitment.

**_Learning How To Learn_**
Chunks are build by focused mode, understanding the basic idea and practice. Recall by trying to remember the key ideas.
Balanced your studies by focusing on the more difficult parts.
Test yourself frequently to know whether you're fooling yourself or you're actually learning. Recall is an example of mini-tests. Mistakes are good. Use deliberate practice the hardest subjects you find.

Law of Serendipity: Lady Luck Favors The One Who Tries. Just pick one tiny thing to learn and then do the same for the others, it's surprising how you'll find out that you're learning quickly.

### Day 1: July 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learning How To Learn by Barbara Oakley.

**Thoughts:** I learned about how to deal with procrastination, using procrastination as a tool instead of an addiction. Learning different learning techniques such as Memory Palace, overlearning, pacing your knowledge, learning something on a balanced duration and not learning in one go. One should also try having a journal and write what they learned. The memory accepts and registers what you learned better than typing it on a keyboard.

### Day 2: July 19, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Officially started, refreshing JavaScript

**Thoughts** Currently learned about the basics of JavaScript again to brush up. Remembered to identify code and running the code. Also learning about JavaScript numbers and math.

Learned about the money problem (float) in JavaScript. It is advised to convert the dollars to cents to avoid inaccuracies when calculating float values. The order of operations and using Math.round().

**_Lesson 2: Numbers and Math_**
**_Lesson 3: Strings_**

### Day 3: July 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learned more bout float problems, strings and other use cases.

**Thoughts** I really hated math, but it's an important aspect. I had a hard time computing the taxes and using Math.round function. Took me a while, need more practice. I also learned some new terms of using strings in JavaScript.

**_Lesson 4: HTML, CSS, console.log and other JS Features Review_**

### Day 4: July 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: HTML, CSS, console.log and other JS features Review

**Thoughts** Reviewed the basics of HTML, and CSS. Set up VSCode. Loading JS inside an HTML file. Comments. console.log() along with practical exercises.

**_Lesson 5: JavaScript Variables and Other JS Features Review_**

### Day 5: July 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Variables and Other Features Review + Practical Exercises and Making a Simple Calculator

**Today's Progress**: Bonus Progress - Booleans and If-statements

**Thoughts**
Reviewed the basics of JavaScript Variables. 3 types of variables, const, let, and var. Learned how to re-assign the variable, replicated AMAZON's cart quality feature by making a simplified version out of it. Shortcuts for re-assigning a variable. Naming conventions and best practices. Along with practical and challenge exercises. Created a simple calculator to test the learned and reviewed skills.

Decided to include some part of the Booleans and if-statements in today's 100 days of code challenge. Practical exercises not included. This is still part 1.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/dan046/simple-calculator-100days-of-code // Note: Doesn't have an interface. Still reviewing variables and prior the lesson, everything is still inline. Will soon update.

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

2. [Title Case a Sentence](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence) -->

### Day 6: July 27, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Booleans and If-statements, More Logical Operators Part 2: Rock-Paper-Scissors Simple Logic Game.

**Thoughts**
Continuation of the JavaScript Refresher, booleans and if-statements. Created a simple logic utilizing the rock paper scissors game algorithm to practice the logic of using conditional statements. Used Math.random() to generate random values used for results in a rock paper scissors game algorithms. Truthy and Falsy Values, shortcuts for if-statements, NaN (Not a Number), undefined values. Ternary, Guard and Default Operators. Also did some practical exercises to further refresh the knowledge.

Notes: Some of the code used in the refresher did ignore the concept of re-declaring block-scoped variables. This is not highly recommended and not the best practice.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/dan046/simple-calculator-100days-of-code // Note: Doesn't have an interface. Still reviewing conditional statements and logical operators and prior the lesson, everything is still inline. Will soon update. Will also update the code to a more dynamic value instead of using conditional statements, i.e. using loops soon. Still uses the same repo.

### Day 7: July 28, 2023

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Refresher Review - Functions

**Thoughts**
Finally started to learn about functions and some takes one need to be actually familiar with it.

**Link to work:** n/a considering to refactor the previous codes made into functions with conditional statements.

### Day 8: July 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Refresher Review - Delve Deeper into Loops, Operators, Some quizzes and exercises.

**Thoughts**
More information about loops and how they are used, also learned more about different operators, especially the bitwise operator. They kind of not needed but good to know as said. also did some quizzes. currently also learning about the conditional statements again which is under the control flow of operations and how they are used in programming.

### Day 9: July 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Refresher Exercises, Logic and Algorithms, Implementing Functions

**Thoughts**
Solved Basic JavaScript Refresher Exercises that would train my mind and methods on how to properly create functions that are clean and could deliver code the best way possible. Exercises like the fizzBuzz Algorithm, checking an image orientation, speed limit algorithm, finding the maximum number between two numbers algorithm, swapping values

### Day 11: August 02, 2023

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Refresher Exercises. Primes, show Stars, Grade, Learned about nested loops.
**Thoughts**
Solved basic to junior level JavaScript Refresher Exercises. Had some issues on providing and finding the logic and algorithm especially the primes. I'm not a fan of math but I know this is important to train my thinking ability on how to get to point A to point B. More so, this does include the probably reasoning on which best path to take in order to create cleaner and readable code.
